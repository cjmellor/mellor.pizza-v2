I saw your [**job listing**](https://rah.no/jobs.html) for a Senior Full-Stack Developer — it popped up on my X feed via the Laravel Jobs board. The role sounds right up my street — so I wanted to throw my hat in the ring.

#### A little about me

My name's Chris, I'm from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and I've been a PHP developer for over 20 years. I've worked in all kinds of industries, working my way up to actually getting paid to code.

After being made redundant in late 2024, I packed up a carry-on bag and headed to Thailand 🇹🇭 to start a new journey working for myself as a freelancer. I picked up some contract work that allowed me to stay in South East Asia and continue travelling. The experience quickly solidified what I had been feeling for years.

During my time there, I developed an entrepreneurial mindset and started building my own SaaS projects. I've had a lot of fun doing it and have more ideas that I soon hope to get the ball rolling on. I'm now back in the UK, but the freelance journey continues.

While my journey is still ongoing, I'm always looking out for exciting new opportunities — and working on a product that helps coaches scale their impact is something I'd love to be part of.

#### Just a quick bit of clarity...

I haven't used React Native before, but it's something I've been wanting to dive into for a while. The closest I've got was building a full **iOS/Android** app using **Ionic** and **CapacitorJS** with **Vue** — a stack I knew absolutely nothing about when I started. Within 6 months, working solo, I had both apps live on the App Store and Google Play. It was a steep learning curve, but I got there.

Similarly, I'd never touched **Shopify** before a recent contract building a plugin for it. I helped build out features, handle user requests, and contribute meaningfully to the product. A lot of this rapid learning was aided by AI tools, which allowed me to pick things up quickly and ship faster than I ever could have before.

As for **Vue.js** — I've used both v2 and v3 (albeit not recently), so maintaining and porting the existing PWA wouldn't be unfamiliar territory.

## My Background

My passion for programming began over 20 years ago and has only grown since. I've been using **Laravel** since *almost* its inception and following its journey ever since.

I've worn many hats in the IT industry — not just development. I've done a lot of **Customer Service** in my time, and that's a skill that never leaves you. I understand how important it is for any company, as the customer is the foundation of everything. I've also done a lot of **DevOps** work — working with **Linux** servers, setting up **CI/CD** pipelines, and working with **Docker** containers. I also once managed and maintained a company's deployment strategy using **Laravel Vapor**, making sure deployments ran smoothly and building out a solution where each Pull Request would be deployed to a staging environment so stakeholders could test changes before they were merged.

## My AI-First Workflow

I've fully embraced the shift towards AI-augmented development — not because of the hype, but because it genuinely makes me better at my job.

My daily driver is **Claude Code**. I use it for everything from deep research and learning new technologies, to code generation, debugging, and product thinking. It's become invaluable for quickly understanding new domains and staying on top of best practices.

This workflow has allowed me to pick up entirely new stacks in a fraction of the time it would have taken before, whilst still understanding what I'm building. It's not about letting AI do the work — it's about using it to ship faster without cutting corners.

## Timezone

I'm based in the UK, so working within CET is no issue at all. I do occasionally travel to South East Asia, but I always work on my clients' timezone regardless of where I am.

## My Contributions

Sadly, I'm unable to share contributions from the companies and clients I've worked for, as they're all private.

However, I've been quite active in the open-source community and have contributed several packages to the Laravel ecosystem. You can see my most starred packages listed on my [**homepage**](https://mellor.pizza), or [**take a look at my GitHub page**](https://github.com/cjmellor) for the full list. A lot of these packages came from wanting to scratch my own itch, and it's been a fun journey building them.

I also encourage you to check out some of the [**articles**](/articles) I've written on my website (albeit a bit out of date now 😅), as well as my [**CV**](/cv) and [**Portfolio**](/portfolio) to understand more about me and what I'm capable of.

## Salary Expectations

I'm looking at the higher end of the range — **$48,000 USD** annually — which aligns with my current rates.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, Rolf — I really appreciate it. I'm excited about the possibility of joining the team and helping build something meaningful. I'd love to chat further and see where I could add value.
