I saw you [**posted on X**](https://x.com/Philo01/status/1980522206183768306) about how you were hiring. At the time, I was busy with another contract, but that has since wrapped up and I remembered your post, so I wanted to throw my hat in the ring — though I understand I might have missed the opportunity as it’s almost two weeks since you posted.

#### A little about me

My name's Chris, I’m from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and I've been a PHP developer for over 20 years. I've worked in all kinds of industries, working my way up to actually getting paid to code.

After being made redundant in late 2024, I packed up a carry-on bag and headed to Thailand 🇹🇭 to start a new journey working for myself as a freelancer. I picked up some contract work that allowed me to stay in South East Asia and continue travelling. The experience quickly solidified what I had been feeling for years.

During my time there, I developed an entrepreneurial mindset and started building my own SaaS projects. I've had a lot of fun doing it and have more ideas that I soon hope to get the ball rolling on.

While my journey is still ongoing, I’m always looking out for exciting new opportunities — and having followed you on your own journey, it’s been very inspirational. The opportunity to work alongside you isn’t something I cannot pass up.

#### Just a quick bit of clarity...

While my direct experience with Shopify is limited, I’m confident in my ability to adapt quickly — I’ve picked up entire stacks before on the fly. For instance, I once built a full **iOS/Android** app in **Ionic/CapacitorJS** with zero prior experience, and it’s now live on both stores.

## My Background

My passion for programming began over 20 years ago and has only grown since. I’ve been using **Laravel** since *almost* its inception and following its journey ever since.

When **Livewire** and **Alpine.js** came out, the game changed for me. The fact I could build the kind of apps I wanted *without* having to write a single line of JavaScript was a huge boost — I’ve never looked back, and it’s my go-to stack for any of my own side projects. I always try to sell the idea of using it to companies and clients — so far, with a 100% success rate.

I've worn many hats in the IT industry — not just development. I’ve done a lot of **Customer Service** in my time, and that’s a skill that never leaves you. I understand how important it is for any company, as the customer is the foundation of everything. I’ve also done a lot of **DevOps** work — working with **Linux** servers, setting up **CI/CD** pipelines, and working with **Docker** containers. I also once managed and maintained a company’s deployment strategy using **Laravel Vapor**, making sure deployments ran smoothly and building out a solution where each Pull Request would be deployed to a staging environment so stakeholders could test changes before they were merged.

## My Contributions

Sadly, I’m unable to share contributions from the companies and clients I’ve worked for, as they’re all private.

However, I’ve been quite active in the open-source community and have contributed several packages to the Laravel ecosystem. Please [**take a look at my GitHub page**](https://github.com/cjmellor) — you’ll find my open-source contributions there. A lot of these packages came from wanting to scratch my own itch, and it’s been a fun journey building them. I hope to build many more in the future.

I also encourage you to check out some of the [**articles**](/articles) I’ve written on my website (albeit a bit out of date now 😅), as well as my [**CV**](/cv) and [**Portfolio**](/portfolio) to understand more about me and what I’m capable of.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, Philo — I really appreciate it. Whether or not the role is still open, it’s been great getting to share a bit about my journey. If there’s an opportunity to collaborate, even in a small capacity, I’d love to chat further and see where I could add value.
